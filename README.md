# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio! This repository showcases my data analysis skills through various projects, including cluster analysis and online sales analysis. Below, you’ll find details about each project, along with the tools and technologies I used to complete them.

## Projects

### 1. **Cluster Analysis (R)**
This project uses the **Framingham Heart Study dataset** to perform a cluster analysis. The goal is to identify patterns and clusters of people based on various health metrics to make predictions about heart disease risk.

#### Technologies Used:
- **R**
- **Cluster Analysis**
- **ggplot2 (for visualization)**

#### Key Insights:
- Identified distinct clusters based on health metrics such as cholesterol levels, age, and smoking habits.
- Found correlations between high cholesterol levels and higher risk of heart disease.

### 2. **Online Sales Data Analysis (Python/SQL)**
This project involves analyzing **online sales data** to understand customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. The analysis includes various types of visualizations such as pie charts, line graphs, and histograms.

#### Technologies Used:
- **SQL (MySQL)**


#### Key Insights:
- Identified top-selling products, seasonal trends, and customer demographics.
