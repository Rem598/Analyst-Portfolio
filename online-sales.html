        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on analyzing an online sales dataset, aiming to uncover trends in customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and seasonality. I used various data visualization techniques to convey insights in a clear and actionable way.</p>
        
        <h2>Approach & Methodology</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Data cleaning and preparation (handling missing data, normalization).</li>
            <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns.</li>
            <li>Created visualizations (pie charts, line graphs, histograms) to represent key metrics.</li>
            <li>Identified trends such as peak sales periods and popular products.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Visualizations & Insights</h2>
        <img src="online-sales-screenshot.jpg" alt="Online Sales Data Screenshot">
        <p>From the analysis, I found that sales peaked during holiday seasons and that certain products consistently outperformed others. These insights can inform inventory and marketing strategies.</p>
