        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project involved performing cluster analysis on the Framingham Heart Study data, a dataset that includes health-related information of individuals. The goal was to group individuals into distinct clusters based on their risk factors for heart disease.</p>
        
        <h2>Approach & Methodology</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values.</li>
            <li>Normalization of data to ensure equal weight across features.</li>
            <li>Application of K-means clustering algorithm to identify patterns.</li>
            <li>Visualizing the results using PCA for dimensionality reduction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Visualizations & Insights</h2>
        <img src="cluster-analysis-screenshot.jpg" alt="Cluster Analysis Screenshot">
        <p>The cluster analysis revealed 3 main groups of individuals, each with varying levels of risk for heart disease. These insights can be useful for targeted healthcare interventions.</p>
